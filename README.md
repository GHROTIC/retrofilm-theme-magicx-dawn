# **<p align=center>RetroFilm Theme for the MagicX Dawn Launcher</p>**

*<p align=center> Image pack for the Dawn Launcher used on the MagicX Zero 28. The default themes included on the Zero 28 tend to be very dark and cover a large majority of the art. Due to this I wanted to add an image pack that was a lot more clear and clean.</p>*

### **<p align=center>-= Notes =-</p>**

* Currently the theme is about 60% complete based on what systems the Dawn Launcher supports. Once all of the images are complete I'll be going back and tweaking logo alignment and quality.
